// 1. Running a program & Writing a console log

// to run a program go into console
// change directory to this folder
// and run ' node 1.js `

// this will execute this program once and quit
// for now nothing will happen but lets try make a "console log"

// now uncomment the line below - to uncomment just remove "//" from the beginning of the line:

// console.log("This is a console log");

// and run the program again

// Congratulations, you've just wrote your first console log!
